# Wifi-Monster-Truck
## Building a Wireless Remote Controlled Rechargeable Monster Truck.
Description:

We made all terrain monster truck with shock absorber, communication through Wi-Fiand controlled by an Android app.
I have tried to create a WIFI controlled Monster Truck using widely used chip boards for embedded applications ex. Arduino and ESP boards. This car is designed to be controlled by a mobile application thereby reducing cost of developing a hardware remote. It has powerful geared motors which provide it high thrust and good speed. Body of the monster truck is custom designed for this application which makes it perfectly optimised for components used internally.

Specifications:

• Height - 11 cm
• Length - 15 cm
• Breadth – 9 cm
• Ground clearance – 2.5 cm
• Weight - 2 kg
• Battery life – 1000 charge cycles

Features:

• High ground clearance
• 4 wheel drive and 2 wheel drive
• Splash proof
• Fast response
• Omni directional movement
• High torque
• Sufficient traction
• Suspension
• Wireless controlling by mobile application
• Speed controlling

Materials used:

• One Node MCU
• One Arduino UNO
• Two L298 motor controllers
• Four 12V Johnson DC geared motor with 500 rpm, stall torque 6kgcm, no load current 0.8A(max), load current 9A(max)
• Four 1:10 RC Monster Truck tires 12mm?
• Four 1/18 Metal shock absorbers 65mm?
• Custom designed metal chassis (having upper and lower parts for complete covering and splash proofing)
• One 14.8V 6600 mAH battery
• 15V 1A DC Adapter
